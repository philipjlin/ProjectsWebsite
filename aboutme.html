      <h3> In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do. </h3>
        <p> Hello! I am a recent graduate just trying to make my way in the fast-moving world
          of software development. My background is in biomedical engineering, and I have worked in
          in research where I have been able to utilize various computational and modeling software to
          help solve health related problems. Both in school and in my work experience I have particularly
          enjoyed working with computers, and I know that is where my career is headed.
         </p>
        <br>

      <h3> Why are you taking this course? </h3>
        <p> I am taking this course because I wish to expand on my knowledge of programming
          and web technologies as I continue to pursue career opportunities in this field. I hope
          that this class will challenge me to explore and improve my skills in both front-end
          design as well as server side management as I complete practical projects in a work-like
          environment with version control, testing, and deployment to a live server. Hopefully by the
          end of the class I'll have some more projects that I would be proud to share!
        </p>
        <br>

      <h3> What previous experience do you have with programming? </h3>
        <p> In terms of programming skills, I am most familiar with object-ordiented
          application design in Java, and have a good understanding of computer science
          related concepts. My knowledge of database management and networking is more limited.
          The greatest challenge for me in this course might be my lack of experience
          in website design and development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and such). And so although I
          feel like I am slightly behind many of my peers in this class, I will be working hard
          to catch up on the material so I can produce projects that reflect what I learn.
        </p>
        <br>

      <h3> Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform? </h3>
        <p> I will be working on a Mac. </p>
        <br>

      <h3> Anything else we should know? </h3>
        <p> As a personal project, I am trying to design and build my own personal web site
          from scratch, and I hope to incorporate some of the things I will be learning in this
          class into that!
